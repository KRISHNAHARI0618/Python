#### Intro To Python

* Managing Data is More Complex
* Python is very useful in data science
* Python is using each and every industry

#### Print Function + String Manipulation

* If you just print it will give simple cursor line
* String Manipulation: + symbol is used to concatenation
* New lines can be added using backslash

#### Input Function in python

* syntax: `input(prompt)`
* by default input function value is string
* mention int , float to changes

#### Variables in Python

* Variable Naming Conventions:
  * a-z,A-Z,0-9 only characters
  * Spaces & Special Characters are not allowed
  * Variable should start with Letter or Underscore
  * Multi-word name is allowed 
  * camelCase is allowed (myName)
  * PascalCase is allowed(MyName)
  * snake case is allowed(My_Name)
  * class not allowed to use as variable
  * python is case-sensitive

#### Data Types:

* Data Types are actually classes in python
* Build-in data types
  * int(-ve +ve),float(.-ve .+ve),string,boolean
* 0B12,0b12 --> Binary Numbers
* 0o12,0O12 --> Octal Numbers
* 0x12,0X12 --> Hexa-Decimal Numbers
* **Type Error**
  * int does not contain any length function

#### Operators

* Operators are used to perform operations
* Arithmatic --> + - % / // 
* Comparison(Relational) --> == >= <= != --> returns true or false
* Logical --> and or nor  ---> returns true or false
* Bitwise --> 
* Assignment
* Identity
* Membership
* Precedence of operators (BOD MAS)
* BOD MAS-Bracket-Division-Multiplication-Addition-Subtraction

#### Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators perform operations on bits and are commonly used for efficient low-level programming. Below is a summary of the bitwise operators:

- **`&`** → **AND**  
  Performs a bitwise AND operation.

- **`|`** → **OR**  
  Performs a bitwise OR operation.

- **`^`** → **XOR**  
  Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation.

- **`~`** → **NOT** (Complement)  
  Inverts all bits (complements the number).  
  Example:  
  `a = 10` → `~a = -11` (The value is negated with one value higher).

- **`<<`** → **Left Shift**  
  Shifts bits to the left, which effectively increases the value.

- **`>>`** → **Right Shift**  
  Shifts bits to the right, which effectively decreases the value.

#### Identity Operators

Identity operators are used to compare the memory locations of two objects. They are:

- **`is`**  
  Returns `True` if both variables refer to the same object in memory.

- **`is not`**  
  Returns `True` if both variables do not refer to the same object in memory.

#### Membership Operators

Membership operators are used to test if a value is found within a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string). They are:

- **`in`**  
  Returns `True` if the value is found in the specified sequence.

- **`not in`**  
  Returns `True` if the value is not found in the specified sequence.

#### Relational Operators

Relational operators are used to compare the values of two operands. They return a boolean value (`True` or `False`). The following are relational operators:

- **`==`**  
  Returns `True` if the values of two operands are equal.

- **`!=`**  
  Returns `True` if the values of two operands are not equal.

- **`>`**  
  Returns `True` if the left operand is greater than the right operand.

- **`<`**  
  Returns `True` if the left operand is less than the right operand.

- **`>=`**  
  Returns `True` if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

- **`<=`**  
  Returns `True` if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

#### Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They can also combine assignment with another operation:

- **`=`**  
  Assigns the value of the right-hand operand to the left-hand operand.

- **`+=`**  
  Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.  
  `a += b` is equivalent to `a = a + b`.

- **`-=`**  
  Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.  
  `a -= b` is equivalent to `a = a - b`.

- **`*=`**  
  Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.  
  `a *= b` is equivalent to `a = a * b`.

- **`/=`**  
  Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.  
  `a /= b` is equivalent to `a = a / b`.

- **`%=`**  
  Takes the modulus of the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.  
  `a %= b` is equivalent to `a = a % b`.

- **`//=`**  
  Performs floor division and assigns the result to the left operand.  
  `a //= b` is equivalent to `a = a // b`.

- **`**=`**  
  Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.  
  `a **= b` is equivalent to `a = a ** b`.

#### Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. They operate on boolean values and return `True` or `False`.

- **`and`**  
  Returns `True` if both operands are `True`.

- **`or`**  
  Returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.

- **`not`**  
  Returns `True` if the operand is `False` and `False` if the operand is `True`.

#### Python `round()` Function

The `round()` function in Python is used to round a floating-point number to a specified number of decimal places. It can also round to the nearest integer if no decimal places are specified.

#### Syntax: ```round(number, ndigits)```
#### F-Strings in Python

F-Strings, short for **formatted string literals**, were introduced in Python 3.6. They provide a concise and readable way to embed expressions inside string literals using curly braces `{}`. The `f` prefix in an f-string's name refers to this feature.

#### Why Use F-Strings?

- **Readability**: F-Strings make it easy to embed variables and expressions directly into strings without using concatenation or older formatting methods like `.format()` or `%`.
- **Performance**: They are faster than `.format()` and `%` formatting because expressions are evaluated at runtime and directly embedded into the string.
- **Flexibility**: They allow embedding any valid Python expression.

#### Syntax

To use an f-string, prefix the string with the letter `f` or `F`, and place expressions inside curly braces `{}`.

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30

# Basic usage
message = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
print(message)  # Output: My name is Alice and I am 30 years old.

# Inline expressions
square = f"The square of 5 is {5**2}."
print(square)  # Output: The square of 5 is 25.

# Function calls
import math
pi_value = f"The value of pi is approximately {math.pi:.2f}."
print(pi_value)  # Output: The value of pi is approximately 3.14.
```

#### Conditional Statements

* if
* else
* else-if
* nested if else
* 

# Python Collections

Python provides several collection types to store and manage data effectively. Each collection type has unique properties and use cases. This document covers the key features, usage, and examples of each collection type.

---

#### **Tuple**

- **Definition**: A `tuple` is an **ordered** and **immutable** collection.
- **Syntax**: Tuples are written in **parentheses** `()`.
- **Key Features**:
  - Cannot be modified once created.
  - Only "get" functions (e.g., accessing elements) are allowed.
  - Operations like addition, subtraction, modifying, or appending are **not allowed**.
  - To perform changes, convert the tuple to a list, modify it, and convert it back to a tuple.
  - Joining and combining tuples is allowed.
  - **Example**:
    ```python
    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
    print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 1
    combined_tuple = my_tuple + (4, 5)
    print(combined_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) ```


#### List in Python

###### **Definition**
A `list` is an **ordered** and **mutable** collection in Python.

##### **Syntax**
Lists are written in **square brackets** `[]`.

###### **Key Features**
- **Mutable**: Elements can be modified, added, or removed.
- Can contain **duplicate values**.
- **Indexing**:
  - Counting starts from `0`.
  - **Negative indexing** is supported (e.g., `-1` for the last element).
- **Slicing**: Retrieve parts of the list using `[start:end:step]`.

##### **Common Methods**
1. **`append()`**: Add an element to the end of the list.
2. **`pop()`**: Remove and return the last element (or a specific index).
3. **`remove()`**: Remove the first occurrence of a specific value.
4. **`insert()`**: Insert an element at a specific position.
5. **`extend()`**: Extend the list by appending elements from another list.

##### **Example**
```python
# Create a list
my_list = [10, 20, 30]

# Append
my_list.append(40)
print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 20, 30, 40]

# Pop
my_list.pop()
print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 20, 30]

# Remove
my_list.remove(20)
print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 30]

# Insert
my_list.insert(1, 25)
print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 25, 30]

# Extend
my_list.extend([35, 40])
print(my_list)  # Output: [10, 25, 30, 35, 40]

# Negative Indexing
print(my_list[-1])  # Output: 40

# Slicing
print(my_list[1:4])  # Output: [25, 30, 35]
```
